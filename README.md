# Econometrics1
This is my first project for my Econometrics course during my bachelo's degree. This project examines the relationship between the short term interest rate and some determining variables in the United States between the years 1987 and 2006. Our data is on a quarterly basis, as we feel that it allows us to have enough data points to proceed with our analysis.
